    "In attempting to solve this problem, I apply feature transformation and dimensionality reduction techniques so as to increase the quality of the feature space. I compare multiple classification algorithms and choose the one that performs best on a separate test dataset. Also, I apply probability calibration methods based on isotonic regression to increase the quality of class probability estimates of my classifier. Lastly, I simulate making bets using my prediction model on the test set and observe the resulting return on investment. The optimal solution would be a classification algorithm with better performance than bookkeeper predictions and a betting strategy powered by said prediction algorithm that achieves positive returns on investment when betting on football matches.

    "###Conclusion\n",
    "In summary, the results of my project reflect a solid first effort in prediction match outcomes in football using machine learning techniques. By comparing multiple classification algorithms in combination with dimensionality reduction, it was discovered that a logistic regression model in combination with a principal component analysis has the best performance. Combining the model selection and tuning process with cross-validation, the robustness and replicability of results is ensured. I firmly believe that this model selection and tuning process can easily be applied to all sorts of classification problems. Another important aspect of the project is the feature creation process since the variety of features that could be created based on the underlying raw data is extremely high. Since existing approaches to football predictions are considered, I created a variety of features that resulted in final model performance superior to bookkeeper prediction accuracy. Creating these features, choosing what aspects of a football match to take into account for prediction, and ensuring that the set of features as a whole fully reflects the bandwidth of facets of a football match was certainly the most difficult part of this project. It remains that football matches are affected by countless factors as well as a high degree of randomness, which makes it impossible to achieve perfect prediction accuracy in my opinion. However, I believe that given more data sources, it is certainly possible to further increase the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to improve the performance of the current implementation, related to, both, feature creation and model training as well as the betting strategy algorithm. First, more data sources could be included in the analysis to further strengthen model performance, e.g. one could include detailed match data such as ball possession as well as shots-on-goal statistics. Second, the model selection process could be further expanded to include more model types as well as feature selection algorithms, however, I am confident that no significant improvements in model performance are achievable in such a manor. Third, the algorithm to translate probability predictions of the final model into a betting strategy could be significantly improved. For instance, one could experiment with varying the amount per bet based on a measure confidence that the model outperforms the bookkeeper.\n",
    "In my honest opinion, I believe it could be possible to predict as much as 65 to 70 percent of matches accurately. Unfortunately, my code can only be run on a sample of all matches on Kaggle due to run time restrictions. The results mentioned in this section are b\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my second machine learning and my first python project. Therefore, please feel free to suggest improvements to the methodology as well as the code. I hope my project can be a basis for more successful attempts to match outcome prediction and will ultimately result in a prediction-based betting strategy that is robust in generating a positive return of investment. Looking forward to hearing your opinion! on running the program on the full data set."
