# Sport's Predictor
### Description
I am making an API, which will accurately predict an outcome of any
 sports event using profound Machine Learning algorithms. The API is meant
  to be used as the core of any sports betting platform.

It also has graphic interface support to provide the same functionality for
 ordinary
 users in a visual and convenient way.
